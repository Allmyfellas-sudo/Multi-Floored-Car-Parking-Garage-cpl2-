# Multi-Floored-Car-Parking-Garage-cpl2-
A project I built for my school exhibition for the subject computer
To use it install python3 on a linux device and plug in an arduino for the program to run you need to connect an arduino
Find out which serial port your arduino is connected to and replace it in the app.py file
find out the ip address of your linux machine by running hostname -I in the terminal and replace PI_IP in the app.py with it
next redirect to the directory your files are saved in on your linux machine using a terminal and enter "pip install pillow pyserial qrcode flask"
after installing the dependancies type python3 app.py in the main directory
Ctrl+click the hostname shown and the program is functional
if you read the arduino code file and plug in 2 servo motors to the correct pin you can use servos too 
Note: this project featured an elevator which was not automated because I didnt have a motor driver and didnt want to risk ruining my arduino
If needed use Microsoft Devtunnels or any alternative to host the program and access it from anywhere in the world which ik why you would want to do somehow. But you do you
This project was very fun to make
If you couldnt understand some parts of this project it is a skill issue make it make sense
Thank You!
